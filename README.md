## :muscle: GitHub Actions Configuration

You can do this in a few ways, here are two different options:

```
- name: Set Playwright framework private package registry
  run: |
    npm config set @justinebateman:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

```
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: "14"
      check-latest: false
      registry-url: "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
      scope: "@justinebateman"
```

## :construction_worker_woman:Ô∏è Development

All changes to `main` need to go in via a Pull Request. In your local clone of
the repository, you'll need to create a branch of `main`, make your changes, update the version number in `package.json`
commit those changes, push the branch up and then create a Pull Request. Pull
requests need to be reviewed and approved before they can be merged.

When a new branch is pushed up, the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous
Delivery) pipeline will automatically run linting against the branch.
