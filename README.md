## :construction_worker_woman:Ô∏è Development

All changes to `main` need to go in via a Pull Request. In your local clone of
the repository, you'll need to create a branch of `main`, make your changes, update the version number in `package.json`
commit those changes, push the branch up and then create a Pull Request. Pull
requests need to be reviewed and approved before they can be merged.

When a new branch is pushed up, the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous
Delivery) pipeline will automatically run linting against the branch.
